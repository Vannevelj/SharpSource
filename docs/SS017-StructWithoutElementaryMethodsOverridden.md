Structs should implement `Equals()`, `GetHashCode()`, and `ToString()`. By default they use reflection which comes with performance penalties.

## Violation
```cs
async void WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```

## Fix
```cs
async Task WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```
