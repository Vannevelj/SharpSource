# SS041 - UnnecessaryEnumerableMaterialization

---

An `IEnumerable` was materialized before a deferred execution call. This generally results in unnecessary work being done.

---

## Violation
```cs
async void WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```

## Fix
```cs
async Task WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```
