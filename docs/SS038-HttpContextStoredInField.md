`HttpContext` was stored in a field. This can result in a previous context being used for subsequent requests. Use `IHttpContextAccessor` instead.

## Violation
```cs
async void WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```

## Fix
```cs
async Task WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```
