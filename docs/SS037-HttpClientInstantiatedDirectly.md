`HttpClient` was instantiated directly. This can result in socket exhaustion and DNS issues in long-running scenarios. Use `IHttpClientFactory` instead.

## Violation
```cs
async void WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```

## Fix
```cs
async Task WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```
