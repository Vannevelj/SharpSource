`[ThreadStatic]` can only be used on static fields. If used on an instance field the attribute will not have any effect and the subsequent multithreading behaviour will not be as intended.

## Violation
```cs
async void WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```

## Fix
```cs
async Task WriteFile()
{
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync("c:/temp", "content")
}
```
